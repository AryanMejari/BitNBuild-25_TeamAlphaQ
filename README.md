Review Radar: Product Sentiment Analyzer is an AI-powered web application and browser extension designed to simplify product review analysis for online shoppers. In today’s e-commerce landscape, products often accumulate hundreds or even thousands of customer reviews, making it difficult for buyers to process this vast amount of information. Review Radar addresses this challenge by automatically scraping reviews from product pages, applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and delivering clear, actionable insights.

The tool leverages a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. Additionally, it performs keyword and topic extraction to highlight the most frequently mentioned product features and issues, such as battery life, display quality, or customer service. The results are presented through a simple, interactive dashboard that provides a sentiment breakdown (e.g., percentage of positive reviews) and lists of top keywords from both positive and negative feedback.

By condensing large volumes of unstructured text into meaningful summaries, Review Radar empowers customers to make faster and more informed purchasing decisions while reducing information overload and “analysis paralysis.”
